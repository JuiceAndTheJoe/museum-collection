# museum-collection
A simple museum collection manager

Using classes and objects, this program manages a fictitious museum collection. This program's functionality could be applied for many simple collections/databases.

Functionality:

- The program handles objects in a museum, containing a name, a description and a historical context.
- The user can create, delete, change and search among the various properties of the object.
- All information is saved on a serialized file between runs (using pickle).
- The program also keeps track of how many times a certain object has been searched for.
- An object can be part of several collections (contexts) at the same time.
- Objects can be loaned. When searching, loaned objects can be shown or hidden and if a certain object loaned, get to know which museum it was loaned to.

Can be improved and extended - this museum is my first sizeable project of its' kind!
